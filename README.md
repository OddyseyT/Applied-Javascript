# Sprint-Challenge Practice - Strek Trek Daily

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past week and apply them in a concrete project. This Sprint explored the DOM and the concept of components. During this Sprint, you studied the DOM, DOM Events, and Components, as well as HTTP GET requests, and the axios library. In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate proficiency by creating an online website called 'Star Trek Daily'

## Description

You are going to create a website for Star Trek fans. Your job is going to be to create the components that make up the website's home page. You will do this at first with static data, then you will request data from a server to create dynamic components.

In meeting the minimum viable product (MVP) specifications listed below, you should have a console full of correct responses to the problems given.
Use the finished-website image for an idea of what your final site should look like.

## Self-Study Questions

Demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering the following free-form questions.

Edit this document to include your answers after each question. Make sure to leave a blank line above and below your answer so it is clear and easy to read by your project manager

1. What is the DOM?
 
DOM stands for document object model.  Its the documented stuff on the screen of a webpage.  It is like a tree with branches (nodes)

2. What is an event?

An event is something the user does to interact with a webpage.

3. What is an event listener?

It is some code that listens for an anticipated response from the user on a web page

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?

A nodelist is limited in the methods that can be applied to work with its data.  Converting it to an array helps make it easier to sort and manipulate its data.

5. What is a component?

I think of stereo components.  They are interchangeable pieces that can be used over and over.  

### Git Set up

* [ ] Fork the project into your GitHub user account
* [ ] Clone the forked project into a directory on your machine
* [ ] Create a pull request before you start working on the project requirements.  You will continuously push your updates throughout the project.
* [ ] You are now ready to build this project with your preferred IDE

## Minimum Viable Product

Your finished project must include all of the following requirements:

* [ ] Look through the HTML code and familiarize yourself with the different sections. Some of them already exist, but some need to be filled in. DO NOT add any code to the HTML file itself.

* [ ] Following the instructions in the `Header/index.js` file, create the Header component. 

* [ ] Following the instructions in the `Tabs/index.js` file, create individual Tabs components.

* [ ] Following the instructions in the `Cards/index.js` file, create individual Cards components.
